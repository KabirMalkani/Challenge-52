# Challenge-52
Video hosting web app with Python/Django/VueJS

To run locally:

- Download directory to your computer
- Install Python 3+
- In command line, pip3 install Django (have not yet set up virtual environment)
- In this folder, run python3 manage.py runserver
- Open link provided in terminal, and go to subdomain '/app'


Reasons for choosing Python/Django Framework:
- Enough personal experience to build this out within a week
- Heavyweight framework, takes care of things like security under the hood
- Large user base, lots of docs, easy to learn since it builds on Python

Considerations:
- Not considered the best choice for non relational data (like video hosting)
- Python does not have built in concurrency handling
